    <h1 id="Album_Name">Studio Album - Nevermind</h1>
    <p><strong>Nevermind</strong> is the second studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991, by DGC Records. Produced by Butch Vig, it was Nirvana's first release on the DGC and the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl. Characterized by its polished and cleaner sound, the album was a departure from the band's rawer debut album Bleach. Nirvana recorded the album at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, and Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in May and June 1991 and it was mastered on the afternoon of August 2 at The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California.

        Frontman Kurt Cobain wrote a number of songs influenced by bands such as the Melvins, R.E.M., the Smithereens, and the Pixies. He fashioned chord sequences using power chords and combined pop hooks with dissonant guitar riffs. According to Cobain, he aimed for the album to sound like a fusion between pop acts like the Knack and the Bay City Rollers and heavier acts like Black Flag and Black Sabbath. While Nevermind is widely associated with grunge, the album features the acoustic ballad "Polly; the hard rock song "Stay Away"; and the cellist-incorporated "Something in the Way".[2] The album cover, which shows a naked baby swimming with a U.S. dollar bill on a fishhook just out of his reach, is one of the most famous album covers in popular music.
        
        Nevermind became an unexpected critical and commercial success. In January 1992, it reached number one on the US Billboard 200; during this time it was selling approximately 300,000 copies a week. The lead single "Smells Like Teen Spirit" peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and its video was heavily rotated on MTV. Three other successful singles were produced: "Come as You Are", "Lithium", and "In Bloom". Nevermind was voted as the best album of the year in Pazz & Jop critics' poll, while "Smells Like Teen Spirit" also topped the single of the year and video of the year polls.
        
        Nevermind was hugely significant for the United States' Generation X, causing punk culture to become prominent among teenagers again.[3] In addition, it was responsible in part for bringing both grunge and alternative rock music to a mainstream audience and ending the dominance of hair metal.[4] The album has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. In March 1999, it was certified Diamond by the RIAA. Among the most acclaimed albums in the history of music, in 2004 the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry, which collects "culturally, historically or aesthetically important" sound recordings. It has appeared in a number of best-album lists, and is often hailed by critics as one of the best albums of all time.</p>

        <h2 id="Album_Group">Artist - NIRVANA</h2>
        <p><strong>Nirvana</strong> was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead singer-songwriter and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with their themes of abjection and social alienation, made them hugely popular during their short tenure. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture.

            In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified Diamond by the RIAA.[1] Nirvana's sudden success popularized alternative rock and was credited for ending the dominance of hair metal, while they were also often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X.
            
            Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, Nirvana released their abrasive and less mainstream sounding third studio album, In Utero (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following Cobain's death in April 1994. Various posthumous releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.
            
            By 2009, Nirvana record sales were over 75 million worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. During their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music Award, Brit Award and Grammy Award, as well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards. They achieved five number-one hits on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and four number-one albums on the Billboard 200. In 2004, Rolling Stone named Nirvana among the 100 greatest artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility in 2014.</p>
